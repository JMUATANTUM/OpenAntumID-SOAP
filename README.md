# OpenAntumID-SOAP (PHP SAMPLE)
A SOAP based version of Open AntumID (DigiByte DigiID)

**OpenAntumID SOAP Authentication Open Protocol**

Pure DigiByte sites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on artificial identification methods such as usernames and passwords. DigiID is an open protocol allowing simple and secure authentication using public-key cryptography.

Classical password authentication is an insecure process that could be solved with public key cryptography. The problem however is that it theoretically offloads a lot of complexity and responsibility on the user. Managing private keys securely is complex. However this complexity is already being addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So doing public key authentication is practically a free lunch to digibyters.
